<h1 align="center">The hub for your team and your work</h1>
<p align="center" color="#6f819a">Slack is a place where your team comes together to collaborate, important information can
    <br/>be found by the right people, and your tools pipe in information when and where you need
    <br/> it.</p>

        <h4>Channels</h4>
        <p>Communication in Slack happens in
            <br/>channels, organized by project, topic,
            <br/>team, or whatever makes sense for
            <br/>you.</p>

        <h4>Search</h4>
        <p>Conversations in Slack are searchable
            <br/>by everyone, so you can tap into
            <br/>company knowledge and find
            <br/>information when you need it.

        <h4>Integrations</h4>
        <p>Slack works with the tools and services
            <br/>you already use every day. Pipe in
            <br/>information or take action without
            <br/>leaving Slack.
